### Workshop

+ **GPU Bootcamp** - 07 / 22 / 2020 @ [NCHC](https://www.nchc.org.tw/)
  - Learned hands-on course using [OpenACC](https://www.openacc.org/) to accelerate Cplusplus compiled code.
  - Realized parallelization and speedup using MPI + OpenACC for [miniWeather](https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather) application.

+ **First Principle Computational Materials Workshop** - 07 / 11 / 2020 @ cloud workshop held by [NCTS](http://phys.cts.nthu.edu.tw/main.php)
  - Learned fundamentals of crystal structure, Bloch theorem, and density function theory.
  - Used [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/) to determine lattice constants, band structure, DOS of $W$ and $Ni$, calculate surface relaxation and work function of $W(100)$ and $Ni(100)$, and find out binding energy and bond length of $O_2$

### Hackathon

+ **Asia-Pacific Mechanics Contest for College Students** - 2017
  - Designed and prototyped a bladeless wind turbine that accurately coincides natural frequency with wind force and produces largest vibration amplitude.
  - Won the first place among approximately 25 groups and earned 50,000 NTD award.
