Pooping is a branch of street dance originating from Oakland, California. Then it was rapidly spread by a Fresno and Long Beach-based group called Electric Boogaloo (EB). EB's combinatorial style successfully drove the dancing community into a frenzy and raised Popping style to the global awareness!

In Popping style, there are many magic moves that can stir up the audience exitement with sharp visual impulse. Its magics relies in the special muscle contraction on the beats of the funk music. As described in Wikipedia,

> The dance is rooted through the rhythms of live funk music, and is based on the technique of Boogaloo's posing approach, quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk or can be a sudden stop in the dancer's body, referred to as a pose, pop or a hit.
