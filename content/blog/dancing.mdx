Pooping is a branch of street dance originating from Oakland, California. Then it was rapidly spreded by a Fresno and Long Beach-based group called Electric Boogaloo (EB). EB's combinatorial style successfully drove the dancing community into a frenzy and disseminated Popping to the other countries.

In Popping style, there are many magic moves that can stir up the audience exitement with acute visual impulse. Its magics relies in the speical muscle use corresponding to the funk music. As described in Wikipedia,

> The dance is rooted through the rhythms of live funk music, and is based on the technique of Boogaloo's posing approach, quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk or can be a sudden stop in the dancer's body, referred to as a pose, pop or a hit.
