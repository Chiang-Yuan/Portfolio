Produced at a quantity of trillion tons per year, cement pastes is the second most-used material on the earth, only second to water. The waste and carbon footprint accompanied with cement have posted a huge threat to the concrete sustainability. **Calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H)**, accounting for 50-60% of bulk cement, is the major binding material responsible for holding aggregates together and providing strength of cement and the entire concrete structure.

In light of the recent aggravating life expectancy of infrastructure, concrete structure calls for improvements in time-dependent properties such as creep and shrinkage from bottom-up approaches. Therefore, understanding cement hydrates from the nanometer scale has become crucial and urgent. With amorphous point defects in silicate network at the nanometer scale, **C-S-H** has a wide range of atomistic configurations and shows polymorphic properties that are difficult to characterize by current experimental approaches. The main focus of this study is to establish multiscale computational framework to quantitatively identify atomic and molecular structure and attribute of cement and concrete materials.
