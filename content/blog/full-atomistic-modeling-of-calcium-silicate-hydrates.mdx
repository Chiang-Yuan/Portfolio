Produced billions of tons per year, cement pastes is the second most-used material on the earth, only second to water. The waste and carbon footprint accompanied by cement has posed a considerable threat to the global sustainability. **Calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H)**, accounting for 50-60% of bulk cement, is the primary binding material responsible for holding aggregates together and providing the strength of cement and concrete structure.

In light of the recent aggravating life expectancy of infrastructure, concrete structure calls for improvements in time-dependent properties such as creep and shrinkage. Therefore, understanding cement hydrates from the nanoscale has become crucial and emerging field at the intersection of mechanics theorem and experiments. With amorphous point defects in silicate network at the nanoscale, **C-S-H** has a wide range of atomistic configurations and shows polymorphic properties that are difficult to characterize by direct experimentation. The main focus of this study is to establish multiscale computational framework to quantitatively identify the molecular structure, mechanical properties, and other physical attributes of cement and concrete materials.
